Android Build
=============


Quick info

	First compile DirectFB for the host (to be sure that all headers
	and flux generated files are created)

	Then in this directory:

	Run
		./prepare.sh

	to fetch and unpack the required freetype2 sources

	Now make sure that the DirectFB-examples folder is in the same
        folder then this DirectFB tree:

       ~|-- whatever
              |-- DirectFB
              |-- DirectFB-examples


	Then go to the df_andi or df_window subfolders located in build-android and type
		ndk-debug

		ant debug

	to get an .apk in bin/.

	You can install it on the device by doing

		ant debug install


	The examples will need their files in /mnt/sdcard/directfb on your device. Do this:

	        adb shell
	        mkdir /mnt/sdcard/directfb
	        ^D

	go to your DirectFB-examples folder and type

		adb push data /mnt/sdcard/directfb/

Now you should be ready to run df_andi and/or df_window on your android device!
