Digital Audio Access Protocol Library
http://daap.sourceforge.net/


*** ABOUT ***

libdaap is a C++ library with C and Objective-C/Cocoa wrappers that will, in
time, implement a full DAAP client and server. It is licensed under the GNU
Lesser Public License, which allows developers to use the library even in
non-free software as long as a few restrictions are followed.

At the moment only the C++ interface is available, and it only understands
the basic format of the data. It does not yet perform any network operations
and thus also doesn't have a higher level interface for listing music and
playlists. It also can only act as a client for the moment.


*** BUILDING ***

libdaap should build and run without any problems on most platforms.  Should
you find this not to be the case, plase contact us and we'll try to get the
problems fixed.  The following commands should get you started:

./configure
make
make check
make install

Running 'make check' gets the build system to run a few tests to make sure
things are running smoothly and that the library is likely to work.

Note also that despite libtool's best efforts to generate shared libraries,
this doesn't work very well on certain platforms.  If a build fails, you
could try configuring libdaap with --disable-shared.


*** DOCUMENTATION ***

Very little documentation is available for the library at the moment, but
hopefully this shall soon be remedied. Most of the documentation is to be
found in the source code, and hopefully that is enough to get certain people
going. We are hoping to post some proper documentation and sample code soon.


*** CONTRIBUTING ***

Contributions to the library are more than welcome. This library is
essentially developed in the authors' free time, so does not get as much
attention as it may need. Contributions can vary from  writing code or
documentation to promoting it (telling your favorite digital audio player's
author about what they could do with this, for example).
